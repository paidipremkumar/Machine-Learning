5158	5159	204	More sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... an amusing little catch .	3
5177	5178	205	Storytelling feels slight .	1
5181	5182	206	Monte Cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .	4
5209	5210	207	It 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Indian film culture that allows Americans to finally revel in its splendor .	4
5239	5240	208	Well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process .	3
5266	5267	209	... only Bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction .	2
5293	5294	210	It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .	0
5317	5318	211	Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as -LRB- Jason Bourne -RRB- .	3
5336	5337	212	Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance .	1
5346	5347	213	When it 's this rich and luscious , who cares ?	3
5359	5360	214	A singularly off-putting romantic comedy .	1
5366	5367	215	Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .	2
5398	5399	216	Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .	0
5428	5429	217	A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .	1
5479	5480	218	An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .	3
5516	5517	219	Cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation -LRB- career - kids = misery -RRB- in tiresome romantic-comedy duds .	1
5541	5542	220	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .	1
5568	5569	221	His work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories .	3
5583	5584	222	An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .	1
5596	5597	223	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .	0
5626	5627	224	The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .	1
5664	5665	225	The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .	0
5682	5683	226	They threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .	1
5716	5717	227	It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .	0
5748	5749	228	Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .	3
5767	5768	229	Jolting into Charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -LRB- accurate ?	2
5795	5796	230	Or both .	2
5797	5798	231	Williams plays Sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in Insomnia .	2
5820	5821	232	Phoned-in business as usual .	1
5826	5827	233	With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .	1
5856	5857	234	Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .	0
5876	5877	235	Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents	0
5893	5894	236	In an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , Narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve .	3
5934	5935	237	A rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hairs on your chest .	3
5952	5953	238	... a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind .	4
5963	5964	239	Miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .	4
5981	5982	240	A chronicle not only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department .	3
6036	6037	241	Provides the kind of ` laugh therapy ' I need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending .	4
6066	6067	242	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .	0
6076	6077	243	At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon .	3
6111	6112	244	Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .	2
6142	6143	245	Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .	3
6179	6180	246	This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .	4
6220	6221	247	Feral and uncomfortable .	1
6225	6226	248	Sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first -LRB- as best I remember -RRB- , but still a very good time at the cinema .	4
6253	6254	249	It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .	3
6281	6282	250	Black-and-white and unrealistic .	0
6286	6287	251	The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol .	3
6304	6305	252	The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .	0
6351	6352	253	Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .	3
6390	6391	254	Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .	1
6430	6431	255	Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere .	4
6448	6449	256	A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .	3
6464	6465	257	Now as a former Gong Show addict , I 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .	3
6502	6503	258	Genuinely unnerving .	3
6506	6507	259	The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .	4
6535	6536	260	One of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .	3
6556	6557	261	A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .	2
6592	6593	262	Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .	1
6601	6602	263	Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .	4
6619	6620	264	One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .	1
6659	6660	265	In fact , even better .	3
6665	6666	266	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .	2
6683	6684	267	Proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie .	2
6700	6701	268	An uplifting , largely bogus story .	2
6707	6708	269	Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods .	4
6737	6738	270	Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .	4
6765	6766	271	A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last .	4
6778	6779	272	After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing	3
6794	6795	273	It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .	1
6812	6813	274	Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .	2
6846	6847	275	Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .	1
6885	6886	276	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .	1
6929	6930	277	The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .	0
6941	6942	278	A mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book .	2
6955	6956	279	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .	0
6980	6981	280	In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .	0
7013	7014	281	A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '	0
7036	7037	282	First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .	1
7052	7053	283	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .	2
7066	7067	284	... silly humbuggery ...	1
7070	7071	285	Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it .	1
7091	7092	286	A smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy .	3
7101	7102	287	-LRB- A -RRB- rather thinly-conceived movie .	0
7108	7109	288	Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .	3
7122	7123	289	Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .	4
7140	7141	290	A slight but sweet film .	3
7145	7146	291	Got a David Lynch jones ?	2
7152	7153	292	Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .	2
7162	7163	293	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .	1
7212	7213	294	`` Austin Powers in Goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end .	4
7241	7242	295	What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .	2
7261	7262	296	The filmmakers might want to look it up .	2
7268	7269	297	While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .	4
7297	7298	298	There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .	4
7322	7323	299	A dreary movie .	0
7326	7327	300	Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .	1
7368	7369	301	To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .	1
7421	7422	302	Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .	3
7451	7452	303	Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .	3
7499	7500	304	What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .	3
7523	7524	305	Buy popcorn .	2
7527	7528	306	A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .	2
7554	7555	307	A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .	1
7583	7584	308	-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .	2
7623	7624	309	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .	3
7647	7648	310	Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .	4
7689	7690	311	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .	1
7707	7708	312	... irritating soul-searching garbage .	0
7714	7715	313	A solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket .	3
7728	7729	314	Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .	2
7744	7745	315	In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .	0
7773	7774	316	Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts .	2
7798	7799	317	Except it 's much , much better .	4
7805	7806	318	It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .	4
7839	7840	319	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .	2
7854	7855	320	has -RRB-	2
7882	7883	321	So original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up .	4
7900	7901	322	It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .	0
7927	7928	323	If you ignore the cliches and concentrate on City by the Sea 's interpersonal drama , it ai n't half-bad .	2
7952	7953	324	A dreadful day in Irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment .	3
7972	7973	325	See it .	4
7973	7974	326	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !	1
7980	7981	327	A guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it .	2
7998	7999	328	Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .	1
8027	8028	329	A relative letdown .	0
8032	8033	330	` Hey Arnold ! '	2
8038	8039	331	But though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .	3
8059	8060	332	The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .	2
8089	8090	333	A non-mystery mystery .	1
8093	8094	334	Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema .	4
8113	8114	335	The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .	3
8124	8125	336	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .	1
8159	8160	337	The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...	2
8168	8169	338	One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .	0
8190	8191	339	Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .	1
8197	8198	340	Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .	1
8220	8221	341	Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '	1
8238	8239	342	With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .	2
8274	8275	343	It labours as storytelling .	1
8279	8280	344	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?	1
8286	8287	345	The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .	3
8332	8333	346	Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .	1
8352	8353	347	... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .	2
8366	8367	348	I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .	1
8382	8383	349	Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .	2
8418	8419	350	When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should come a-knocking , no ?	2
8436	8437	351	If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .	2
8478	8479	352	It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .	2
8521	8522	353	For a movie audience , The Hours does n't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love .	2
8554	8555	354	Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .	1
8580	8581	355	Too clever by about nine-tenths .	3
8586	8587	356	This is no `` Waterboy ! ''	1
8593	8594	357	They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .	2
8608	8609	358	The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .	2
8644	8645	359	Not as good as the original , but what is ...	2
8651	8652	360	Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give `` Scratch '' a second look .	4
8672	8673	361	Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable .	3
8692	8693	362	An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .	1
8704	8705	363	Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .	0
8721	8722	364	Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings .	2
8744	8745	365	The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .	0
8775	8776	366	With or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller	4
8797	8798	367	Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .	3
8843	8844	368	A terrific date movie , whatever your orientation .	3
8852	8853	369	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .	0
8879	8880	370	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?	1
8893	8894	371	Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '	1
8905	8906	372	`` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .	4
8938	8939	373	Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .	2
8955	8956	374	An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .	4
8990	8991	375	Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and Heaven is one such beast .	4
9008	9009	376	Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .	4
9023	9024	377	Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misunderstood career .	4
9054	9055	378	Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .	1
9063	9064	379	... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .	1
9084	9085	380	Nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` Memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` Requiem for a Dream . '	3
9111	9112	381	Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible .	4
9148	9149	382	Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .	0
9167	9168	383	This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .	0
9187	9188	384	Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .	1
9205	9206	385	Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .	4
9221	9222	386	Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .	1
9261	9262	387	`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .	2
9300	9301	388	Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .	4
9325	9326	389	The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Everyman is in the details .	3
9343	9344	390	The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .	1
9383	9384	391	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .	1
9415	9416	392	Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .	3
9445	9446	393	In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .	2
9464	9465	394	As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .	4
9484	9485	395	Maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is .	3
9507	9508	396	Would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ?	2
9527	9528	397	Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .	0
9550	9551	398	This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .	1
9581	9582	399	To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .	1
9597	9598	400	Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .	3
9620	9621	401	A porn film without the sex scenes .	2
9628	9629	402	The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .	2
9650	9651	403	Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -	3
9707	9708	404	Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .	1
9737	9738	405	`` Barbershop '' is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story .	3
9757	9758	406	A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .	1
9783	9784	407	An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .	2
9811	9812	408	Consistently clever and suspenseful .	4

10003	10004	421	It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .	4
10038	10039	422	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke	1
10050	10051	423	Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .	1
10089	10090	424	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .	3
10115	10116	425	Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .	1
10132	10133	426	Though writer\/director Bart Freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of Crudup 's anchoring performance .	3
10170	10171	427	-LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .	0
10195	10196	428	This beautifully animated epic is never dull .	4
10203	10204	429	Charming and witty , it 's also somewhat clumsy .	3
10211	10212	430	In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .	1

10275	10276	432	Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell ?	2
10283	10284	433	A serviceable Euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , BMWs and seaside chateaus .	2
10318	10319	434	Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .	2
10344	10345	435	It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .	4
10359	10360	436	The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .	1
10370	10371	437	Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .	1
10410	10411	438	It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .	4
10437	10438	439	A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .	1
10449	10450	440	Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .	1
10466	10467	441	Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .	1
10483	10484	442	Mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt .	2

10543	10544	445	The concept is a hoot .	3
10549	10550	446	A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given .	4
10566	10567	447	The directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge	2
10591	10592	448	What Eric Schaeffer has accomplished with Never Again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary .	2

10657	10658	452	Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .	1
10682	10683	453	A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .	1
10699	10700	454	Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .	1
10722	10723	455	Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements .	2
10736	10737	456	Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !	3
10746	10747	457	Sweet Home Alabama is n't going to win any Academy Awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts .	3
10772	10773	458	Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .	1
10791	10792	459	Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .	1
10821	10822	460	The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .	1
10852	10853	461	In some ways , Lagaan is quintessential Bollywood .	2
10863	10864	462	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .	1
10871	10872	463	A wry , affectionate delight .	4

10895	10896	465	The auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug .	3
10921	10922	466	Gets better after Foster leaves that little room .	3
10931	10932	467	Despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .	3
10969	10970	468	Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .	1
10996	10997	469	As lively an account as Seinfeld is deadpan .	1
11008	11009	470	Brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women 's depression .	2
11023	11024	471	Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .	1
11060	11061	472	Definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . '	3
11081	11082	473	A heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope .	3
11094	11095	474	An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema .	4
11103	11104	475	An extremely unpleasant film .	0

11121	11122	478	Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .	2
11149	11150	479	I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .	4
11166	11167	480	Intelligent and moving .	4
11170	11171	481	This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .	1
11191	11192	482	Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .	2
11221	11222	483	The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .	3
11239	11240	484	As Warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years .	2
11262	11263	485	It should have stayed there .	1
11268	11269	486	... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .	0
11297	11298	487	It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .	0
11332	11333	488	There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .	1
11377	11378	489	There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .	3
11421	11422	490	Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .	4
11428	11429	491	This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .	0
11444	11445	492	As saccharine as it is disposable .	1
11452	11453	493	Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics .	4
11469	11470	494	A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad .	2
11486	11487	495	An exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama .	4
11495	11496	496	Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .	1
11523	11524	497	Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .	4
11569	11570	498	She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit .	3
11583	11584	499	Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed .	3
11596	11597	500	So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .	1
11609	11610	501	Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .	4
11620	11621	502	The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .	1
11655	11656	503	The cast comes through even when the movie does n't .	2
11662	11663	504	A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .	3
11697	11698	505	It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .	3
11739	11740	506	Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .	2
11753	11754	507	But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .	0
11789	11790	508	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .	1
11800	11801	509	I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .	4
11859	11860	510	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .	2
11899	11900	511	One Hour Photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director Mark Romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .	1
11943	11944	512	With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .	2
11965	11966	513	A processed comedy chop suey .	1
11972	11973	514	eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .	3
11984	11985	515	Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .	1
12004	12005	516	So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride .	3
12034	12035	517	An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist -LRB- not to mention gently political -RRB- meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement .	4
12074	12075	518	I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .	0
12110	12111	519	A sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in Renaissance Spain , and the fact that it 's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling .	4
12146	12147	520	The Santa Clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .	3
12172	12173	521	Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .	0
12203	12204	522	It 's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth .	3
12227	12228	523	Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .	3
12247	12248	524	Goes on and on to the point of nausea .	1
12256	12257	525	-LRB- Raimi 's -RRB- matured quite a bit with Spider-Man , even though it 's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you 'll ever see .	2
12288	12289	526	It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .	1
12319	12320	527	An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .	1
12337	12338	528	In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '	3
12368	12369	529	A modestly surprising movie .	3
12373	12374	530	... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .	4
12384	12385	531	Combines improbable melodrama -LRB- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -RRB- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .	3
12422	12423	532	This is one of Mr. Chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny .	3
12439	12440	533	This one is strictly a lightweight escapist film .	2
12448	12449	534	It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .	2
12463	12464	535	If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''	1
12490	12491	536	Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .	1
12512	12513	537	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .	1
12542	12543	538	There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .	3
12561	12562	539	` This movie sucks . '	0
12566	12567	540	Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .	1
12586	12587	541	A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .	1
12607	12608	542	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .	1
12625	12626	543	What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .	3
12649	12650	544	The film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .	4
12665	12666	545	Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time	2
12677	12678	546	One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .	2
12698	12699	547	Schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness .	1
12721	12722	548	After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .	0
12739	12740	549	Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .	1
12760	12761	550	A small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .	3
12783	12784	551	Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .	2
12817	12818	552	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .	0
12859	12860	553	The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .	3

13087	13088	563	Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .	1
13112	13113	564	Evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes .	1
13133	13134	565	Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .	4
13165	13166	566	This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .	3
13189	13190	567	A thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you can not separate them .	3

13533	13534	582	Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .	1
13573	13574	583	The real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , Jean Reno , who resembles Sly Stallone in a hot sake half-sleep .	2
13607	13608	584	And there 's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after Greene 's story ends .	3

13783	13784	595	There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics	3
13835	13836	596	It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift .	2
13876	13877	597	The difference is that I truly enjoyed most of Mostly Martha while I ne	3
13891	13892	598	I ca n't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail .	2
13911	13912	599	Falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice .	1
13930	13931	600	The early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us .	4
13948	13949	601	Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .	1
13971	13972	602	A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .	2

14098	14099	608	A compelling allegory about the last days of Germany 's democratic Weimar Republic .	3
14116	14117	609	Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .	1
14140	14141	610	It is an indelible epic American story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .	2
14172	14173	611	It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .	4
14192	14193	612	... -LRB- the film -RRB- works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .	3
14209	14210	613	You walk out of The Good Girl with mixed emotions -- disapproval of Justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions .	3
14237	14238	614	The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .	2
14276	14277	615	Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .	1
14286	14287	616	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .	1
14308	14309	617	The immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary Space Station 3D .	4
14339	14340	618	A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .	0
14361	14362	619	Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .	1
14373	14374	620	Muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and The Last Kiss ... provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .	4
14412	14413	621	It challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should .	3
14426	14427	622	Read My Lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love .	4
14457	14458	623	An hour and a half of joyful solo performance .	4
14468	14469	624	Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .	3
14483	14484	625	Better than the tepid Star Trek : Insurrection ; falls short of First Contact because the villain could n't pick the lint off Borg Queen Alice Krige 's cape ; and finishes half a parsec -LRB- a nose -RRB- ahead of Generations .	2
14541	14542	626	Exploits -LRB- headbanger -RRB- stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter .	3
14562	14563	627	It 's just rather leaden and dull .	0
14569	14570	628	Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .	1
14584	14585	629	Although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters .	3
14609	14610	630	A deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world .	3
14626	14627	631	The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .	2
14654	14655	632	From the opening strains of the Average White Band 's `` Pick up the Pieces '' , you can feel the love .	3
14678	14679	633	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .	1
14708	14709	634	Triple X is a double agent , and he 's one bad dude .	3
14725	14726	635	There has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but Peter Mattei 's Love in the Time of Money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive -LRB- if tragic -RRB- note .	3
14776	14777	636	This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential	3
14817	14818	637	As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .	4
14828	14829	638	Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .	1
14849	14850	639	The filmmakers ' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls ' environment .	3
14872	14873	640	It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .	2

14938	14939	642	Enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers .	3
14962	14963	643	How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?	1
14978	14979	644	Only at the prospect of Beck 's next project .	2
14989	14990	645	... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .	4
15012	15013	646	A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .	4
15039	15040	647	Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .	0
15069	15070	648	They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .	3
15086	15087	649	It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .	0
15102	15103	650	Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?	0
15135	15136	651	Evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking .	3
15154	15155	652	All three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly Balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents .	4
15178	15179	653	The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .	2
15203	15204	654	You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .	3
15255	15256	655	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .	1
15294	15295	656	Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .	1
15321	15322	657	So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted Rembrandt .	4
15359	15360	658	Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .	1
15400	15401	659	In other words , it 's badder than bad .	0
15411	15412	660	Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .	0
15416	15417	661	Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .	1
15447	15448	662	Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .	1
15468	15469	663	Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade .	4
15490	15491	664	With an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera	3
15512	15513	665	You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .	2
15529	15530	666	A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .	1
15548	15549	667	Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .	1
15579	15580	668	If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''	2
15615	15616	669	So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .	0
15627	15628	670	Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there	2
15642	15643	671	Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .	0
15653	15654	672	The Hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame .	3
15679	15680	673	Delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information .	3
15693	15694	674	Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .	2
15709	15710	675	-LRB- Dong -RRB- makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets you riled up .	4
15742	15743	676	Light the candles , bring out the cake and do n't fret about the calories because there 's precious little substance in Birthday Girl -- it 's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .	4
15784	15785	677	In his debut as a director , Washington has a sure hand .	4
15796	15797	678	-- but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I 've had in a while .	4
15818	15819	679	This is not Chabrol 's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer .	2
15837	15838	680	The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death .	3
15856	15857	681	It 's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffith made in the early days of silent film .	4
15876	15877	682	The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .	1
15903	15904	683	The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .	4
15943	15944	684	If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .	2
15957	15958	685	When all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , I trust , will you .	3
15979	15980	686	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .	3
16006	16007	687	Director Claude Chabrol has become the master of innuendo .	3
16015	16016	688	Woven together handsomely , recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from Lonely Boy to Do n't Look Back .	3
16036	16037	689	It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars	0
16053	16054	690	Paul Cox needed to show it .	1
16061	16062	691	A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .	2
16082	16083	692	The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .	3
16104	16105	693	They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .	1
16123	16124	694	moved	3

16148	16149	696	A piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .	2
16163	16164	697	This movie is to be cherished .	4
16169	16170	698	The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have loved it .	4
16183	16184	699	Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .	1
16195	16196	700	While Tattoo borrows heavily from both Seven and The Silence of the Lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .	4
16233	16234	701	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .	1
16255	16256	702	The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .	3
16304	16305	703	Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , Scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting .	3
16341	16342	704	While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .	1
16375	16376	705	Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''	3
16412	16413	706	A real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .	4
16423	16424	707	Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine .	2
16451	16452	708	Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .	2
16475	16476	709	Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .	4
16507	16508	710	Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .	0
16535	16536	711	I 'd watch these two together again in a New York minute .	4
16548	16549	712	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .	0
16560	16561	713	Ferrara 's best film in years .	4
16566	16567	714	Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .	2
16590	16591	715	No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .	3
16601	16602	716	... a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on Rice 's second installment of her Vampire Chronicles .	2

16631	16632	718	Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .	1
16649	16650	719	None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...	1
16661	16662	720	Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .	1
16686	16687	721	It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists .	2
16717	16718	722	Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about Zelda 's ultimate fate .	4
16738	16739	723	Successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie .	3
16756	16757	724	Really is a pan-American movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart .	3
16774	16775	725	Same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse .	2
16791	16792	726	The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead -LRB- water -RRB- weight of the other .	1
16811	16812	727	Crikey indeed .	2
16814	16815	728	It 's exactly what you 'd expect .	2
16822	16823	729	It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .	1
16851	16852	730	You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .	0
16882	16883	731	A stirring road movie .	3
16885	16886	732	If you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart .	3
16907	16908	733	It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .	3
16936	16937	734	It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .	1
16951	16952	735	Perhaps the best sports movie I 've ever seen .	4
16959	16960	736	Just send it to Cranky .	1
16966	16967	737	Steven Soderbergh does n't remake Andrei Tarkovsky 's Solaris so much as distill it .	1
16982	16983	738	Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .	1
17025	17026	739	In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .	1
17065	17066	740	Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .	1
17085	17086	741	New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...	2
17099	17100	742	Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .	1
17108	17109	743	With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .	1
17136	17137	744	Van Wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest .	1
17167	17168	745	No , even that 's too committed .	1
17175	17176	746	The large-frame IMAX camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .	4

17273	17274	750	What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .	2
17290	17291	751	It 'll keep you wide awake and ... very tense .	3
17303	17304	752	The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .	1
17348	17349	753	It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .	3
17366	17367	754	Less an examination of neo-Nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .	3
17383	17384	755	Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works , Invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .	4
17416	17417	756	While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .	3
17457	17458	757	There are no special effects , and no Hollywood endings .	3
17467	17468	758	Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .	1
17501	17502	759	Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .	3
17527	17528	760	From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .	4
17562	17563	761	The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .	2
17589	17590	762	A stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help Chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact .	3
17616	17617	763	Fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy .	3

17659	17660	765	You can sip your vintage wines and watch your Merchant Ivory productions ; I 'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a Jerry Bruckheimer flick any day of the week .	4

17731	17732	768	It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .	2
17745	17746	769	Hugely accomplished slice of Hitchcockian suspense .	3
17753	17754	770	A generic international version of a typical American horror film .	1
17764	17765	771	The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .	2
17790	17791	772	Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .	4
17816	17817	773	Charlotte Sometimes is a gem .	3

21805	21806	976	An EXIT sign , that is .	1
21810	21811	977	It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .	2
21839	21840	978	The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .	4
21882	21883	979	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .	1
21912	21913	980	Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .	3
21931	21932	981	It drowns in sap .	1
21937	21938	982	` Rare Birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .	2

21994	21995	987	Bland but harmless .	1
21997	21998	988	Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout .	1
22025	22026	989	A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours -LRB- and , for that matter , Shrek -RRB- .	1
22070	22071	990	It 's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .	3
22094	22095	991	No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .	1
22115	22116	992	The film exudes the urbane sweetness that Woody Allen seems to have bitterly forsaken .	3
22134	22135	993	The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .	1
22147	22148	994	Cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle .	3
22166	22167	995	What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .	0
22207	22208	996	I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .	0
22216	22217	997	There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .	0

22257	22258	1001	None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .	1
22269	22270	1002	An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .	0

22358	22359	1008	I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .	2
22377	22378	1009	is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .	2
22388	22389	1010	Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation .	1
22409	22410	1011	Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .	0
22422	22423	1012	The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad .	1
22431	22432	1013	That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''	1
22452	22453	1014	Solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .	2
22465	22466	1015	Includes too much obvious padding .	1
22472	22473	1016	Well , they 're ` they ' .	2
22479	22480	1017	Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .	1
22504	22505	1018	-LRB- A -RRB- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting .	4
22518	22519	1019	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .	1
22534	22535	1020	For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .	3
22583	22584	1021	The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .	4
22602	22603	1022	As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .	2
22624	22625	1023	Alternately frustrating and rewarding .	3
22630	22631	1024	I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .	2

22656	22657	1026	Anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .	4
22682	22683	1027	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .	1
22694	22695	1028	-- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .	1
22732	22733	1029	Interesting , but not compelling .	2
22736	22737	1030	`` Catch Me '' feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark .	3
22764	22765	1031	An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .	2
22784	22785	1032	The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react .	3
22834	22835	1033	Eh .	2
22836	22837	1034	Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .	0
22857	22858	1035	The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .	2
22876	22877	1036	-LRB- Stephen -RRB- Earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have .	3
22913	22914	1037	Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .	1
22938	22939	1038	Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .	1
22977	22978	1039	The modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases	4

22995	22996	1041	A sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer .	1
23005	23006	1042	A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .	1
23021	23022	1043	-LRB- I -RRB- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .	1

23146	23147	1049	A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .	1
23172	23173	1050	Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .	0

23442	23443	1064	With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .	1
23484	23485	1065	A light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .	1
23509	23510	1066	They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .	1

24058	24059	1094	Despite its Hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of `` Lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage Shirley Temple script .	1

25477	25478	1166	At its best when the guarded , resentful Betty and the manipulative yet needy Margot are front and center .	2
25502	25503	1167	Director Tom Dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon , but Showtime 's uninspired send-up of TV cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .	3
25542	25543	1168	I wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` Slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but I laughed so much that I did n't mind .	2
25570	25571	1169	Sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy ... Attal looks so much like a young Robert DeNiro that it seems the film should instead be called ` My Husband Is Travis Bickle ' .	4
25607	25608	1170	It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` Look at this !	3
25632	25633	1171	A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .	0

25667	25668	1173	aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there 's little to be learned from watching ` Comedian '	2
25700	25701	1174	One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .	4
25715	25716	1175	An intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time .	3
25739	25740	1176	It 's still a comic book , but Maguire makes it a comic book with soul .	3
25753	25754	1177	Where the film falters is in its tone .	1
25761	25762	1178	Amazing !	4
25762	25763	1179	A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .	2
25798	25799	1180	Wow , so who knew Charles Dickens could be so light-hearted ?	3
25813	25814	1181	Hey , Happy !	3

25841	25842	1184	More than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology ...	2

25883	25884	1186	-LRB- Kirshner wins , but it 's close . -RRB-	2
25894	25895	1187	Like Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .	0
25933	25934	1188	The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible IMAX sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes .	4
25967	25968	1189	Even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , Spy Kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man .	1
25998	25999	1190	The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .	0
26031	26032	1191	None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .	2
26051	26052	1192	The heat of the moment prevails .	3
26058	26059	1193	Wait for it to hit cable .	2
26065	26066	1194	Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .	1
26099	26100	1195	-LRB- A -RRB- satisfying niblet .	3
26103	26104	1196	But they fascinate in their recklessness .	3
26110	26111	1197	If you have n't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in Spielberg 's work .	3
26132	26133	1198	Me no lika da accents so good , but I thoroughly enjoyed the love story .	3
26148	26149	1199	The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .	1
26195	26196	1200	A timid , soggy near miss .	1
26203	26204	1201	hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .	1
26226	26227	1202	It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .	3
26253	26254	1203	The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .	2
26286	26287	1204	Watching E.T now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .	2

26417	26418	1212	Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .	1
26444	26445	1213	The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .	1
26460	26461	1214	If you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , Sweet Home Alabama is diverting in the manner of Jeff Foxworthy 's stand-up act .	2
26489	26490	1215	Oh , look at that clever angle !	3
26498	26499	1216	A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .	0
26517	26518	1217	This version moves beyond the original 's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema 's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .	2
26550	26551	1218	Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !	2
26566	26567	1219	I do n't know if Frailty will turn Bill Paxton into an A-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie .	3
26601	26602	1220	This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .	0
26619	26620	1221	There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .	1
26636	26637	1222	Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .	2
26653	26654	1223	The Santa Clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry .	1
26679	26680	1224	An energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching -LRB- or turntablism -RRB- in particular .	4
26707	26708	1225	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	1
26725	26726	1226	Instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , Schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view .	3
26749	26750	1227	Compellingly watchable .	4
26752	26753	1228	Other than the slightly flawed -LRB- and fairly unbelievable -RRB- finale , everything else is top shelf .	3
26771	26772	1229	This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel , Seth Green and Barry Pepper .	2
26807	26808	1230	The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his .	1
26832	26833	1231	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .	1
26843	26844	1232	Blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch-perfect Holden .	4
26873	26874	1233	It is n't scary .	1
26876	26877	1234	And it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .	3
26912	26913	1235	Like a fish that 's lived too long , Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .	1
26930	26931	1236	Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .	1
26939	26940	1237	A seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by Georgian-Israeli director Dover Kosashvili .	3
26954	26955	1238	-LRB- It 's -RRB- a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest .	3
26968	26969	1239	If you 're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat Brussels sprouts .	1
26986	26987	1240	The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .	1
27005	27006	1241	Maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor .	4

27076	27077	1245	Kinnear ... gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life 's ultimate losers .	4
27097	27098	1246	Their work is fantastic .	4
27101	27102	1247	As a movie , it never seems fresh and vital .	2
27111	27112	1248	Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .	0
27133	27134	1249	With Notorious C.H.O. Cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with Pryor , Carlin and Murphy .	3

27299	27300	1255	LaBute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : He 's changed the male academic from a lower-class Brit to an American , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .	2
27344	27345	1256	A virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze .	2
27356	27357	1257	Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .	2
27380	27381	1258	You might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` Simone , '' and consider a DVD rental instead .	1
27409	27410	1259	About a Boy vividly recalls the Cary Grant of Room for One More , Houseboat and Father Goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him .	2

27525	27526	1265	A dazzling dream of a documentary .	4
27530	27531	1266	An intelligently made -LRB- and beautifully edited -RRB- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the Hollywood pipeline without a hitch .	4
27570	27571	1267	The unexplored story opportunities of `` Punch-Drunk Love '' may have worked against the maker 's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer\/director Anderson .	3
27602	27603	1268	Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane .	1
27638	27639	1269	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .	3
27659	27660	1270	Rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle	3
27677	27678	1271	Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up .	4

28287	28288	1304	Otherwise , maybe .	2

28407	28408	1314	Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .	2
28424	28425	1315	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder may aim to be the next Animal House , but it more closely resembles this year 's version of Tomcats .	2

28482	28483	1318	Director Chris Wedge and screenwriters Michael Berg , Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage Looney Tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time .	3
28523	28524	1319	The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''	1

28841	28842	1337	The actors are fantastic .	4
28844	28845	1338	It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .	3
28880	28881	1339	The Trinity Assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and George Ratliff 's documentary , Hell House , reflects their earnestness -- which makes for a terrifying film .	2

29182	29183	1351	This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .	4
29208	29209	1352	All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .	1
29229	29230	1353	A beautifully observed character piece .	4
29234	29235	1354	Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .	2
29265	29266	1355	Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .	0
29270	29271	1356	Does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story .	3
29286	29287	1357	In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .	0
29297	29298	1358	Spare yet audacious ...	2
29300	29301	1359	With three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it 's enough to make you wish Jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .	2
29347	29348	1360	After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .	0
29386	29387	1361	Could n't someone take Rob Schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?	1
29399	29400	1362	Formuliac , but fun .	3
29404	29405	1363	What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .	0
29425	29426	1364	The sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in IMAX dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins .	3
29460	29461	1365	As Hannibal would say , yes , ` It 's like having an old friend for dinner ' .	3
29481	29482	1366	Williams absolutely nails Sy 's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness .	3
29494	29495	1367	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .	1
29514	29515	1368	This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '	0
29549	29550	1369	Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .	0
29560	29561	1370	The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .	4
29581	29582	1371	An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .	0
29596	29597	1372	This deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications .	3
29612	29613	1373	There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .	0
29645	29646	1374	The filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching .	3
29680	29681	1375	Does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of Richard Nixon .	2
29705	29706	1376	Go , girls , right down the reality drain .	1
29715	29716	1377	The power of Shanghai Ghetto , a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s .	3
29756	29757	1378	Funny and touching .	3
29758	29759	1379	There is nothing redeeming about this movie .	0
29764	29765	1380	It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .	3
29779	29780	1381	The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .	0
29799	29800	1382	It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .	1
29819	29820	1383	A stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world 's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making .	4
29863	29864	1384	A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .	1
29879	29880	1385	If you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then Triple X marks the spot .	3
29897	29898	1386	The simplicity of The Way Home has few equals this side of Aesop	2
29911	29912	1387	The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .	1
29930	29931	1388	The film is saved from are n't - kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked and a stately sense of composition .	3
29954	29955	1389	A few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks .	1
29971	29972	1390	Like any good romance , Son of the Bride , proves it 's never too late to learn .	3
29987	29988	1391	One of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but ... also one of the most curiously depressing .	3
30004	30005	1392	A film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure .	3
30015	30016	1393	An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .	1
30024	30025	1394	... the story , like Ravel 's Bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with .	3
30051	30052	1395	This thing is virtually unwatchable .	0
30056	30057	1396	The movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds .	3
30103	30104	1397	What a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride .	4
30115	30116	1398	And , thanks to the presence of ` the King , ' it also rocks .	3
30130	30131	1399	I do n't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold .	3
30164	30165	1400	Everybody loves a David and Goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from David 's point of view .	3
30184	30185	1401	The performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .	3
30200	30201	1402	An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .	1
30209	30210	1403	Ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family .	2
30231	30232	1404	It has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .	3
30272	30273	1405	It 's just not very smart .	1
30277	30278	1406	It wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy Hawaiian shirt .	1

30313	30314	1408	A wild ride with eight boarders from Venice Beach that was a deserved co-winner of the Audience Award for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival .	4
30339	30340	1409	But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .	0
30360	30361	1410	Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .	3
30404	30405	1411	Toward the end Sum of All Fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .	1
30418	30419	1412	Your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , Madonna 's cameo does n't suck !	3
30442	30443	1413	The production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating .	4
30452	30453	1414	For almost the first two-thirds of Martin Scorsese 's 168-minute Gangs of New York , I was entranced .	3
30474	30475	1415	A brutally dry satire of Middle American numbness .	1
30484	30485	1416	A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .	2
30499	30500	1417	The tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story 's morals .	3
30523	30524	1418	And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .	1
30531	30532	1419	Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .	0
30558	30559	1420	Nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil .	4
30585	30586	1421	Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .	3
30605	30606	1422	With lesser talents , High Crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable .	2
30616	30617	1423	The history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling .	4
30623	30624	1424	I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .	1
30636	30637	1425	All in all , Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .	3
30652	30653	1426	DeMeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material .	2
30663	30664	1427	Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .	1
30696	30697	1428	... gripping and handsome execution , -LRB- but -RRB- there is n't much about K-19 that 's unique or memorable .	2
30713	30714	1429	I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .	0
30734	30735	1430	An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .	0
30746	30747	1431	... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 's ... The film 's ending has a `` What was it all for ? ''	0
30786	30787	1432	Check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do n't want to think too much about what 's going on .	1
30813	30814	1433	Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .	1
30825	30826	1434	The Pianist is the film Roman Polanski may have been born to make .	3
30835	30836	1435	It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .	3
30846	30847	1436	The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .	4
30872	30873	1437	There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .	2
30892	30893	1438	Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .	1
30906	30907	1439	Alas , another breathless movie about same !	2
30915	30916	1440	-LRB- Reaches -RRB- wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair .	3
30928	30929	1441	If you do n't ... well , skip to another review .	2
30938	30939	1442	In my opinion , Analyze That is not as funny or entertaining as Analyze This , but it is a respectable sequel .	2
30960	30961	1443	A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .	0
30976	30977	1444	Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .	1
31003	31004	1445	This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie I 've seen this summer .	1
31027	31028	1446	Entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately ... dare I say , entertaining !	4
31040	31041	1447	`` Red Dragon '' is entertaining .	4
31045	31046	1448	Quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor .	3
31058	31059	1449	It winds up moving in many directions as it searches -LRB- vainly , I think -RRB- for something fresh to say .	1
31079	31080	1450	An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it .	3
31096	31097	1451	Fear permeates the whole of Stortelling , Todd Solondz ' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .	3
31118	31119	1452	As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .	3
31127	31128	1453	Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .	0
31142	31143	1454	You wo n't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these Veggies .	3
31156	31157	1455	Some may choose to interpret the film 's end as hopeful or optimistic but I think Payne is after something darker .	2
31178	31179	1456	Scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern Lothario .	4
31193	31194	1457	Overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper .	1
31199	31200	1458	Steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate Manhattan denizens -- especially the a \*\* holes .	2
31227	31228	1459	These two are generating about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory poised to receive a UN inspector .	2
31250	31251	1460	Jeffrey Tambor 's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is Oscar-worthy .	4
31265	31266	1461	This familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it 's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times .	3
31298	31299	1462	Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .	0
31307	31308	1463	Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .	1
31314	31315	1464	Insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it does n't disgrace it , either .	2
31335	31336	1465	No. .	1
31337	31338	1466	To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .	0
31368	31369	1467	It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .	0
31400	31401	1468	At 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth .	4
31414	31415	1469	You have to see it .	4
31417	31418	1470	If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .	0
31431	31432	1471	A tasty slice of droll whimsy .	2
31438	31439	1472	... while the humor aspects of ` Jason X ' were far more entertaining than I had expected , everything else about the film tanks .	1
31460	31461	1473	Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .	1
31487	31488	1474	Broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force .	2
31513	31514	1475	Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .	1
31533	31534	1476	The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card .	1
31544	31545	1477	With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .	0
31569	31570	1478	The film oozes craft .	3
31574	31575	1479	Stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .	3
31594	31595	1480	Weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title .	3
31610	31611	1481	There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .	1
31625	31626	1482	But it does somehow manage to get you under its spell .	3
31637	31638	1483	Brian Tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .	4
31664	31665	1484	Uplifting , funny and wise .	3
31668	31669	1485	Old people will love this movie , and I mean that in the nicest possible way : Last Orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship .	2
31704	31705	1486	A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .	0
31722	31723	1487	These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and I 'm all for that .	3
31756	31757	1488	Just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer .	4
31769	31770	1489	It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .	4
31796	31797	1490	... the efforts of its star , Kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught .	1
31817	31818	1491	A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .	1
31837	31838	1492	That ` Alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of Witherspoon -LRB- who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate -RRB- ...	3
31880	31881	1493	Starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and Bruce Willis with a scar .	0
31912	31913	1494	World Traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .	3
31934	31935	1495	You would n't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit .	3
31951	31952	1496	Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche , No Such Thing is Hartley 's least accessible screed yet .	1
31981	31982	1497	A simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm .	4
32003	32004	1498	Those who do n't entirely ` get ' Godard 's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy .	3
32029	32030	1499	Yes , soar .	3
32033	32034	1500	A genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives .	4
32061	32062	1501	Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .	0
32078	32079	1502	Qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere .	2
32093	32094	1503	has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a `` 2 '' at the end of its title .	3
32115	32116	1504	Throughout , Mr. Audiard 's direction is fluid and quick .	3
32126	32127	1505	A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .	1
32142	32143	1506	A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .	0
32167	32168	1507	One of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while ...	4
32178	32179	1508	Nicole Kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that Birthday Girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while .	3
32212	32213	1509	It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .	2
32228	32229	1510	Oops , she 's really done it this time .	2
32236	32237	1511	The characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life .	4
32253	32254	1512	Jackson is always watchable .	3
32256	32257	1513	Deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .	4
32270	32271	1514	Terry is a sort of geriatric Dirty Harry , which will please Eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man .	3
32306	32307	1515	-LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .	1
32340	32341	1516	It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .	3
32367	32368	1517	Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .	1
32383	32384	1518	A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .	1
32396	32397	1519	Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .	1
32423	32424	1520	Time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness .	4
32439	32440	1521	In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .	1
32468	32469	1522	While Insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , Nolan 's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends -LRB- it -RRB- stimulating depth .	3
32500	32501	1523	The Pianist -LRB- is -RRB- a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life .	4
32526	32527	1524	It does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .	3
32539	32540	1525	Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .	2
32547	32548	1526	Seems like someone going through the motions .	1
32551	32552	1527	While I ca n't say it 's on par with the first one , Stuart Little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie .	3
32574	32575	1528	And he allows a gawky actor like Spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range .	3
32603	32604	1529	The Chateau belongs to Rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting French malapropisms ... is a nonstop hoot .	3
32629	32630	1530	The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .	0
32660	32661	1531	At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .	1
32687	32688	1532	What is the filmmakers ' point ?	2
32691	32692	1533	Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .	0

32846	32847	1539	The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .	3
32881	32882	1540	An ugly , revolting movie .	1
32887	32888	1541	It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .	3
32911	32912	1542	Like Kissing Jessica Stein , Amy 's Orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor .	3
32936	32937	1543	The main problem being that it 's only a peek .	2
32946	32947	1544	As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .	0
32982	32983	1545	But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .	0

33150	33151	1554	`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors	3
33172	33173	1555	This is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one .	1
33190	33191	1556	A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .	2

33274	33275	1559	A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire .	4
33292	33293	1560	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .	0
33310	33311	1561	Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .	1
33329	33330	1562	It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .	1
33353	33354	1563	And thanks to Kline 's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable .	4
33370	33371	1564	The film was n't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .	2
33381	33382	1565	A lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe .	3
33397	33398	1566	Miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .	4

33526	33527	1573	Vividly demonstrates that the director of such Hollywood blockbusters as Patriot Games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop .	4
33554	33555	1574	An overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort .	3

33798	33799	1589	Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .	2
33845	33846	1590	The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .	2
33878	33879	1591	A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .	0

34070	34071	1601	On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .	2
34089	34090	1602	Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .	1
34116	34117	1603	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	1
34147	34148	1604	That 's because relatively nothing happens .	1
34153	34154	1605	` Snow Dogs ' has both .	2
34158	34159	1606	A decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit Franklin needs to stay afloat in Hollywood .	3
34183	34184	1607	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .	0
34217	34218	1608	The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .	2
34233	34234	1609	Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .	2
34272	34273	1610	As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .	4
34298	34299	1611	Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .	4
34338	34339	1612	Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .	1
34359	34360	1613	Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs .	4
34373	34374	1614	It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .	2
34389	34390	1615	One of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society .	3
34413	34414	1616	A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .	0
34422	34423	1617	... one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages ...	4
34432	34433	1618	The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .	1
34464	34465	1619	With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .	1
34490	34491	1620	The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .	1
34507	34508	1621	... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .	2
34524	34525	1622	A reality-snubbing hodgepodge .	1
34529	34530	1623	... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .	0
34553	34554	1624	The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance .	3
34564	34565	1625	There are things to like about Murder By Numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements do n't gel .	2
34583	34584	1626	Quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and Moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between Jane Wyman and June Cleaver .	3
34626	34627	1627	What begins as a film in the tradition of The Graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .	2
34649	34650	1628	Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .	1
34664	34665	1629	A brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel .	4
34675	34676	1630	The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .	4
34689	34690	1631	It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .	2
34704	34705	1632	Some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the Ball and Chain .	2
34725	34726	1633	One of the funnier movies in town .	4
34732	34733	1634	The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` Baran . '	4
34754	34755	1635	American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .	1
34781	34782	1636	An elegant film	2
34789	34790	1637	An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship .	4
34807	34808	1638	A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .	0
34825	34826	1639	A stylistic romp that 's always fun to watch .	4
34833	34834	1640	Like its title character , this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .	3
34864	34865	1641	Although mainstream American movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel .	3
34898	34899	1642	Film ca n't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout .	2
34912	34913	1643	It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .	3
34934	34935	1644	A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded Elvis fans -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- will have fun with .	4
34954	34955	1645	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .	1
34981	34982	1646	Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved	0
35001	35002	1647	There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a Hollywood career , if they want one .	3
35036	35037	1648	The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .	1
35064	35065	1649	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .	1
35086	35087	1650	Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White 's dry wit to a new age .	4
35116	35117	1651	The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time .	3
35151	35152	1652	That is because - damn it !	2
35157	35158	1653	It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .	0
35178	35179	1654	What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .	2
35195	35196	1655	This may be Burns 's strongest film since The Brothers McMullen .	4
35208	35209	1656	No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .	1
35246	35247	1657	Deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant .	3
35254	35255	1658	When twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we 'd live in if Argento 's Hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve .	3
35293	35294	1659	But it 's worth the concentration .	3
35300	35301	1660	Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '	1
35329	35330	1661	But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .	0
35336	35337	1662	It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .	0
35372	35373	1663	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .	1
35398	35399	1664	A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .	4
35412	35413	1665	It is a movie about passion .	2
35417	35418	1666	Certainly .	2
35418	35419	1667	But what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .	4
35432	35433	1668	Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .	1
35465	35466	1669	... another example of how Sandler is losing his touch .	1
35475	35476	1670	This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground .	4
35501	35502	1671	A fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion .	3
35511	35512	1672	Efficient , suitably anonymous chiller .	3
35520	35521	1673	This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .	2
35541	35542	1674	The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .	0
35563	35564	1675	This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .	1
35578	35579	1676	Gently humorous and touching .	3
35581	35582	1677	At its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .	2
35598	35599	1678	It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .	4
35646	35647	1679	Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .	2
35676	35677	1680	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?	2
35683	35684	1681	Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .	1
35692	35693	1682	The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .	2
35708	35709	1683	Represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging Indian American cinema .	3
35727	35728	1684	A compelling film .	4
35729	35730	1685	The movie is well done , but slow .	1
35735	35736	1686	It is up to you to decide if you need to see it .	2
35746	35747	1687	Yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it 's so fascinating you wo n't be able to look away for a second .	3
35769	35770	1688	`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .	0
35792	35793	1689	I 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but Real Women Have Curves truly is life affirming .	3
35818	35819	1690	No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .	1
35832	35833	1691	Offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film .	4
35854	35855	1692	The worst film of the year .	0
35856	35857	1693	` Christian Bale 's Quinn -LRB- is -RRB- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '	1
35892	35893	1694	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .	0
35918	35919	1695	Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .	2
35933	35934	1696	Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .	0
35946	35947	1697	A raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted Korean American stand-up 's I 'm the One That I Want .	3
35966	35967	1698	Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .	4
35980	35981	1699	The most brilliant and brutal UK crime film since Jack Carter went back to Newcastle , the first half of Gangster No. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .	4
36014	36015	1700	Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .	0
36055	36056	1701	Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles .	4
36081	36082	1702	Yet the act is still charming here .	3
36088	36089	1703	The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	1
36095	36096	1704	It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...	4
36112	36113	1705	He drags it back , single-handed .	3
36119	36120	1706	It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...	2
36131	36132	1707	A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .	1
36156	36157	1708	A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .	2
36171	36172	1709	of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation	3
36191	36192	1710	Often hilarious .	3
36192	36193	1711	I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .	1
36227	36228	1712	An elegant work , Food of Love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing .	3
36242	36243	1713	The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .	1
36258	36259	1714	Give Shapiro , Goldman , and Bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .	1
36284	36285	1715	... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .	0
36310	36311	1716	It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .	3
36333	36334	1717	I like it .	3
36335	36336	1718	On its own , Big Trouble could be considered a funny little film .	3
36345	36346	1719	It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .	3
36371	36372	1720	This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .	1
36392	36393	1721	Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .	0
36407	36408	1722	Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .	0
36423	36424	1723	A knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite Son of the Bride .	4
36434	36435	1724	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .	1
36464	36465	1725	The Son Of The Bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues .	4
36491	36492	1726	Even if the Naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .	4
36510	36511	1727	Ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .	3
36531	36532	1728	Most of the things that made the original Men in Black such a pleasure are still there .	3
36546	36547	1729	At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -LRB- depending upon where you live -RRB- , Ignorant Fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .	3
36580	36581	1730	Or for the year , for that matter .	2
36585	36586	1731	I had more fun watching Spy than I had with most of the big summer movies .	4
36600	36601	1732	It 's just merely very bad .	0
36604	36605	1733	the shackles	2
36618	36619	1734	Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .	3
36640	36641	1735	You can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards .	3
36662	36663	1736	Some movies blend together as they become distant memories .	2
36671	36672	1737	Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .	0
36694	36695	1738	Chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . '	3
36717	36718	1739	Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .	1
36725	36726	1740	It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .	1
36735	36736	1741	And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .	0
36746	36747	1742	As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .	0
36783	36784	1743	They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .	1
36798	36799	1744	For all the dolorous trim , Secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop Freudianism .	3
36833	36834	1745	Like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen 's astringent wit .	3
36855	36856	1746	A taut , sobering film .	4
36862	36863	1747	Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .	2
36882	36883	1748	A muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any Scorsese has ever given us .	3
36898	36899	1749	The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .	4
36928	36929	1750	But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .	4
36944	36945	1751	Directed with purpose and finesse by England 's Roger Mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as Notting Hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft .	4
36985	36986	1752	One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .	1
37012	37013	1753	A wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films .	3
37024	37025	1754	Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .	1
37045	37046	1755	Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .	2
37061	37062	1756	Elvira fans could hardly ask for more .	4
37068	37069	1757	Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .	2
37079	37080	1758	Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .	4
37105	37106	1759	It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .	0
37116	37117	1760	... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .	0
37141	37142	1761	Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .	2
37148	37149	1762	... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''	1
37177	37178	1763	Murder by Numbers ' is n't a great movie , but it 's a perfectly acceptable widget .	2
37191	37192	1764	It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''	0
37204	37205	1765	But it would be better to wait for the video .	1
37214	37215	1766	Delirious fun .	4
37217	37218	1767	There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .	1
37233	37234	1768	Special P.O.V. camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense IMAX screen .	4
37259	37260	1769	There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .	4
37271	37272	1770	A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .	2
37315	37316	1771	`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .	0
37335	37336	1772	... the first 2\/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices -LRB- cool visual backmasking -RRB- , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ...	4
37373	37374	1773	This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time .	4
37381	37382	1774	Auto Focus is not your standard Hollywood bio-pic .	2
37388	37389	1775	`` Not really as bad as you might think ! ''	2
37398	37399	1776	Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .	3
37413	37414	1777	Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .	1
37445	37446	1778	One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning .	4
37475	37476	1779	I saw Juwanna Mann so you do n't have to .	2
37483	37484	1780	Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .	0
37494	37495	1781	What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .	1
37509	37510	1782	... they missed the boat .	2
37515	37516	1783	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .	0
37524	37525	1784	As an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , Derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable .	3
37561	37562	1785	A delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie .	4
37569	37570	1786	... Despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '	3
37596	37597	1787	Clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up .	1
37620	37621	1788	Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .	1
37638	37639	1789	And Vin Diesel is the man .	3
37642	37643	1790	Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break .	1
37668	37669	1791	While there are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it does n't .	3
37688	37689	1792	Richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings .	4
37700	37701	1793	It 's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn .	3
37714	37715	1794	... a bland , pretentious mess .	1
37720	37721	1795	The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .	0
37729	37730	1796	Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .	3
37764	37765	1797	The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .	1
37797	37798	1798	Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters .	3
37822	37823	1799	Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .	1
37850	37851	1800	The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .	4
37863	37864	1801	Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .	1
37883	37884	1802	An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .	1
37898	37899	1803	` Tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of The Next Pretty Good Thing .	2
37924	37925	1804	Those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up .	3
37945	37946	1805	She 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .	4
37970	37971	1806	Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...	0
37996	37997	1807	It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .	3
38019	38020	1808	At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes .	2
38034	38035	1809	Bill Morrison 's Decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .	4
38048	38049	1810	-LRB- Shyamalan -RRB- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .	3
38079	38080	1811	I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .	1
38096	38097	1812	I know that I 'll never listen to Marvin Gaye or the Supremes the same way again	3
38115	38116	1813	Like Shrek , Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .	4
38151	38152	1814	Saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .	3
38169	38170	1815	I 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper .	1
38185	38186	1816	Tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here .	3
38199	38200	1817	Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .	1
38219	38220	1818	And people make fun of me for liking Showgirls .	1
38229	38230	1819	You just know something terrible is going to happen .	2
38237	38238	1820	Much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever .	3
38251	38252	1821	Writer \/ director M. Night Shyamalan 's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable .	3
38272	38273	1822	Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '	1
38299	38300	1823	This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .	1
38310	38311	1824	A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .	0
38330	38331	1825	Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .	1
38346	38347	1826	is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .	2
38363	38364	1827	For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .	0
38381	38382	1828	The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .	1
38409	38410	1829	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .	1
38423	38424	1830	Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .	2
38434	38435	1831	would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .	2
38449	38450	1832	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .	0
38467	38468	1833	If you 're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you 're at the right film .	3
38500	38501	1834	Poignant and delicately complex .	3
38504	38505	1835	Intriguing and stylish .	4
38507	38508	1836	It was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .	2
38529	38530	1837	It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .	1
38547	38548	1838	The trick when watching Godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them .	3
38588	38589	1839	A biopic about Crane 's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video .	2
38612	38613	1840	With exquisite craftsmanship ... Olivier Assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois French society .	3
38632	38633	1841	However sincere it may be , The Rising Place never quite justifies its own existence .	1
38645	38646	1842	The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .	2
38654	38655	1843	What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .	1
38678	38679	1844	Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .	0
38712	38713	1845	Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .	0
38732	38733	1846	You get the idea , though , that Kapur intended the film to be more than that .	2
38748	38749	1847	O.K. , not really .	2
38753	38754	1848	Both deserve better .	1
38757	38758	1849	Parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults .	4
38784	38785	1850	A tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .	3
38793	38794	1851	The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .	2
38826	38827	1852	Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .	2
38842	38843	1853	Even kids deserve better .	1
38844	38845	1854	That the real Antwone Fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle .	4
38884	38885	1855	Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .	3
38913	38914	1856	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .	0
38932	38933	1857	Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .	2
38949	38950	1858	Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .	0
38956	38957	1859	If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .	1
38989	38990	1860	`` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .	2
39008	39009	1861	If you do n't laugh , flee .	2
39015	39016	1862	that it 'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture	3
39038	39039	1863	On its own , it 's not very interesting .	1
39044	39045	1864	Leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .	3
39060	39061	1865	The rich performances by Friel -- and especially Williams , an American actress who becomes fully English -- round out the square edges .	3
39086	39087	1866	The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .	0
39119	39120	1867	The movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star Bruce Willis .	3
39154	39155	1868	Five screenwriters	2
39169	39170	1869	About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .	1
39194	39195	1870	Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda .	1
39202	39203	1871	Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .	0
39212	39213	1872	Nicole Holofcenter , the insightful writer\/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully .	3
39239	39240	1873	One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .	2
39269	39270	1874	Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .	1
39285	39286	1875	Boring and meandering .	0
39288	39289	1876	No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .	1
39313	39314	1877	The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .	4
39333	39334	1878	Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .	1
39360	39361	1879	Why ?	1
39361	39362	1880	Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .	1
39379	39380	1881	It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .	1
39392	39393	1882	A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .	0
39415	39416	1883	Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .	1
39447	39448	1884	A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .	1
39466	39467	1885	-LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .	1
39490	39491	1886	Texan director George Ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .	4
39514	39515	1887	The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .	1
39549	39550	1888	Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .	1
39566	39567	1889	Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .	0
39595	39596	1890	The Wild Thornberrys Movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough .	3
39614	39615	1891	The audacity to view one of Shakespeare 's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion .	1
39639	39640	1892	Throw Smoochy from the train !	1
39646	39647	1893	If you 're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you 're in luck .	4
39665	39666	1894	De Ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .	2
39690	39691	1895	Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .	0
39700	39701	1896	Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .	1
39719	39720	1897	A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .	1
39740	39741	1898	In the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .	3
39753	39754	1899	It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .	4

40055	40056	1919	For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .	1

40324	40325	1931	Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .	1
40363	40364	1932	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .	1
40399	40400	1933	The Bourne Identity should n't be half as entertaining as it is , but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood .	3

42890	42891	2072	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .	1
42903	42904	2073	Gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet 's mouth .	2
42929	42930	2074	Stuffed to the brim with ideas , American instigator Michael Moore 's film is a rambling examination of American gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition .	3
42966	42967	2075	At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .	3
42977	42978	2076	Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .	2

43175	43176	2086	This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them .	2
43197	43198	2087	It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .	2
